Write a function that provides change directory (cd) function for an abstract file system.

Notes:

Root path is '/'.
Path separator is '/'.
Parent directory is addressable as "..".
Directory names consist only of English alphabet letters (A-Z and a-z).
The function will not be passed any invalid paths.
Do not use built-in path-related functions.

For example:
  
  Path path = new Path("/a/b/c/d");
  path.cd('../x');
  System.out.println(path.getPath());

should display '/a/b/c/x'.
